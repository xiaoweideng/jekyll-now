title: Number Theory: Lucas number
---

Lucas number is one of my research topic when I was an undergrad in UBC. Lucas number is less well-known than its "big brother", Fibonacci number, however, they both share some interesting identities and recurrence relation: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? X_{n+1} = X_n + X_{n-1} " />. Lucas number is defined as following:

*Definition* 

Lucas numbers form a sequence, and are defined by the recurrence relation:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? L_{n+1} = L_n + L_{n-1}, \text{where} n \geq 1 " />


with initial condition <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? L_0 = 2, L_1 = 1" />.
