title: Number Theory: Lucas number
---

Lucas number is one of my research topic when I was an undergrad in UBC. Lucas number is less well-known than its "big brother", Fibonacci number, however, they both share some interesting identities and recurrence relation: $X_{n+1} = X_n + X_{n-1}$. Lucas number is defined as following:

*Definition* Lucas numbers form a sequence, and are defined by the recurrence relation:

$$
L_{n+1} = L_n + L_{n-1}, \text{where} n \geq 1
$$

with initial condition $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$.
